      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application. Docker is a tool that is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators, making it a part of many DevOps (developers + operations) toolchains. Docker is also a company that promotes and evolves this technology, working in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors, including Microsoft.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX, pronounced as “engine-ex,” is a famous open source web server software. In its initial release, it functioned for HTTP web serving. Today, however, it also serves as a reverse proxy, HTTP load balancer, and email proxy for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP. 
      One worker connection can take care of up to 1024 similar requests. Because of that, NGINX can process thousands of requests without any difficulties. It is also the reason why NGINX became excellent for busy websites like e-commerce, search engines, and cloud storage. - list all sources you used. NGINX is a powerful web server and uses a non-threaded, event-driven architecture that enables it to outperform Apache if configured correctly. It can also do other important things, such as load balancing, HTTP caching, or be used as a reverse proxy.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer. A virtual machine, usually known as a guest is created within another computing environment referred as a "host." Multiple virtual machines can exist within a single host at one time. A virtual machine is also known as a guest. The virtual machine is comprised of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host. Every virtual machine has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability, and security.A virtual machine consists of several types of files that you store on a supported storage device. The key files that make up a virtual machine are the configuration file, virtual disk file, NVRAM setting file, and the log file. You configure virtual machine settings through the vSphere Web Client or the vSphere Client. You do not need to touch the key files. - - References: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4805/virtual-machine-vm; https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere</p>
      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers. DigitalOcean is very popular with open source developers and competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Compute Engine. To deploy DigitalOcean's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, developers launch a private virtual machine (VM) instance, which DigitalOcean calls a "droplet." Developers choose the droplet's size, which geographical region and data center it will run in, and which Linux operating system it will use: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS or FreeBSD. Once paid for, DigitalOcean instances, called droplets, generally start in less than a minute. When combined with their reasonable pricing, this speed makes DigitialOcean droplets ideal for the buildup and tear-down common when testing and debugging new sites. DigitalOcean’s droplets are akin to what other companies call “instances” or “virtual servers.” A droplet feels like a standalone box on your desk because you get the root password and access to all the file system, enabling you to configure it anyway you like. This is a bit of a facade because droplets are really virtual machines, each a share of a much larger machine that appears to be an independent server under your control. With this setup, it's relatively easy to resize your droplet to add more memory or disk space if your application demands it.- - References: https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/DigitalOcean; https://www.infoworld.com/article/3166936/cloud-made-easy-get-started-with-digital-ocean.html</p>
